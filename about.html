<p>Hi, I am Utkarsh Agrawal I am mostly interested in Web Application, Networks, Mobile Application Penetration testing. <br>Also I enjoyed a lot to automate the things in Python. I have also written a tool named <a href="https://github.com/agrawalsmart7/autorecon">AutoRecon</a>, which I had presented in Conference at Goa. </p>
